<p><i><b><font face="Verdana" size="5">The Early Years</font></b></i><br>

<br>

<font face="Verdana">Brown Chemical was founded in 1936 by William
Brown. The original site, which the company still uses today, was
located in northeastern New Jersey on Warren Street in Paterson, the
center of what was then a strong textile mill market segment.&nbsp; The
company primarily
serviced the northern New Jersey area and had a somewhat limited
product line and customer
base.&nbsp; After World War Two the Company had become well established
in
the growing textile trade in all of North Jersey and was looking to
expand distribution of
its products into additional markets, such as the chemical
manufacturing and metal
treating industries springing up in New Jersey. The Founder, William
Brown, passed away in the year of 1955 and was succeeded by Arthur
Brown.&nbsp; Under Art Brown's leadership the company continued to grow
and invest in new
marketplaces.&nbsp; Brown Chemical began to actively pursue additional
marketplaces for its
products - specialty chemical manufacturing, industrial and
institutional cleaners,
pigments and dyestuffs. Brown also increased its size and marketing
areas to coincide with
these additional industries. </font> <br>
